# Eye_Mechanism: POST-PROCESSING
This was the most physically challenging and artsy!
<h3>Putting Together the Pieces</h3>
<p>This was the most physically challenging, as the Standard PLA Filament used was not as flexible and brittle, so I had to be more careful</p>
<p>This is also one of the first projects where I was using my hands so I was pretty weak haha.</p>
<h3>PAINTING</h3>
<p>
  This was the most physically fun part! I had three types of paints and one glossy gesto:
  <ul>
    <li>White Paint - I used white paint as a base. The blue filament was very vibrant I had to apply two to three coats.</li>
    <li>Yellow Paint - I used a lighter yellow paint for the eye color. I wanted a similar eye color like Bender's from Futurama since he's a big inspiration for my Robotics career choice.</li>
    <li>Black Paint - I used black paint for the pupils which gave it some life.</li>
    <li>Glossy Gesto - I built up two layers on the eyeballs to give a glossy shine, and multiple layers in the pupils to give more of a realistic appearance.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>The time it took to dry and repaint also took a long time, but my little fan helped with the process and painting the eyeballs while they're on the mechanism already made the process slightly easier to hold and not smudge.</p>
