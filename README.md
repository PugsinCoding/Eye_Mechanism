# Eye_Mechanism: PRINTING
<p>The longest part of the process! Takes about a day as far as I remember, so be patient! I used basic PLA filament and a Bambu Lab A1 3D Printer</p>
<h1>Final Print</h1>
<p>This shows the result of printing the eye mechanism overnight</p>
<p>This was the easiest part of the project, and this branch will only have one file as most of the work went into post-processing with building, painting, circuits and programming.</p>
