# Eye_Mechanism
The Printing and Circuit Connections to make the eye mechanism come to life
<h3>PRINTING</h3>
<p>The longest part of the process! Takes about a day as far as I remember, so be patient! I used basic PLA filament and a Bambu Lab A1 3D Printer</p>
<h3>PUTTING TOGETHER</h3>
<p>If you are not used to working with your hands you might have to dremel or shave off a bit of the inside of the holes.
I used PLA filament and it was extremely difficult putting together until I dremeled (be careful with the dremel)
</p>
<h3>PAINTING</h3>
<p>I suggest sanding before painting, and make sure to use a layer or so of primer and a matte or gloss finish on top.
Trust me, this is how I got my eyes to go from dark blue to a dingy glossy light yellow.
</p>
<h3>CODE</h3>
<p>Code will be posted soon. For motors to be dead center they will start at 90 instead of 0</p>
