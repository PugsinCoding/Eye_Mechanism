<h3>THE BREADBOARD AND ARDUINO</h3>
<p>I used a small breadboard as well as an Arduino Uno R3. This is different from the Will Cogley Instructions since he uses a Raspberry Pi, however I wanted to use the Microcontroller Boards I already had.</p>
<p>I used a YouTube tutorial on how to attach the motors to the breadboard and to the Arduino, which I will link here: [put YouTube Link Here]. However, One difference is that I decided to use a switch, originally a button, to turn the mechanism on or off (Pictures/Videos of board with both Button and Switch will be within this branch).</p>
