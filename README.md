# Eye_Mechanism: PROGRAMMING
Using programming to bring the mechanism to life
<h3>IDE</h3>
<p>I used the standard Arduino IDE. This connects directly with the Arduino Uno I used for this project.</p>
<h2>Why not Raspberry?</h2>
<p>I know the tutorial said to use a Raspberry Pi, however I wanted to use the microcontrollers I already had, as I am a broke college student. I also thought this change would be minute enough to where nothing can terribly go wrong, but big enough to where it challenges my Arduino programming and problem solving skills.</p>
<h3>What Will be in This Branch?</h3>
<p>There will be 3 files. One is the actual sequence of actions that the mechanism will complete when turned on. The second is the starting motor positions, with proper commentary on max and mins of each motor variable. The final is a clear arduino file, which can be uploaded when something goes terribly wrong and the motors lock up.</p>
